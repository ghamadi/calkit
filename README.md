# CALKIT 
A small web application that enables customized calculation templates.

> **Note**

> This project is still in the early stages of development. There are no stable features yet.

## Planned Features
### **1. Bracket Calculations**
- Create templates of unlimited brackets
- Define custom input and ouput units per template
- Perform single or bulk computations
- Visualize the applied brackets for each result

#### _Example use cases:_ 
- Electric bill
- Tax calculation

### **2. Formula Evaluation**
- Create templates of unlimited mathematical formulas with any number of variables
- Attach labels to formulas
- Define a custom unit per variable
- Evaluate the full template against any input
- Perform single or bulk evaluation 

#### _Example use cases:_ 
- Evaluation of general algebreic expressions
- Labels allow for practical uses (such as measurement reductions)
